        <h2>1945</h2>
        <p>Vannevar Bush writes <a href="">an article</a>  in  <a href="">Atlantic Monthly</a> about a
             photo-electrical-mechanical device called a Memex, for 
             memory extension, which could make and follow links 
             between documents on microfiche</p>
             <h2>1960s</h2>
             <p>Doug Engelbart prototypes an "oNLine System" (NLS) which
             does hypertext browsing editing, email, and so on.
              He invents the mouse for this purpose. See the <a href="">Bootstrap
                Institute library.</a><br><br>Ted Nelson coins the word Hypertext in 
            <i>A File Structure for the Complex, the Changing, and the Indeterminate.</i>
            20th National Conference, New York, <a href="">Association for Computing Machinery</a> ,
            1965. See also: Literary Machines. Note: There used to be a link
            here to "Hypertext and Hypermedia: A Selected Bibliography" by Terence
            Harpold, but the site hosting the resource did not maintain the link. <br><br>

            <h2>1980</h2>
            <p>While consulting for CERN June-December of 1980, Tim Berners-Lee writes a
             notebook program, "Enquire-Within-Upon-Everything", which allows links to
            be made between arbitrary nodes. Each node had a title, a type, and a list
            of bidirectional typed links. "ENQUIRE" ran on Norsk Data machines under
            SINTRAN-III. See: <a href="">Enquire user manual as scanned images</a>  or  <a href="">as HTML page(alt)</a>.</p>
            <h2>1989</h2>
            <p>March<br>
               <a href="">"Information Management: A Proposal"</a>  written by <a href="">Tim BL</a> and circulated
             for comments at <a href="">CERN</a>  (TBL). Paper "HyperText and CERN" produced as background
            ( <a href="">text</a> or <a href="">WriteNow </a> format).
            </p>
            <h2>1990</h2>
            <p>May <br>
            Same <a href="">proposal</a> recirculated <br> September <br>Mike Sendall, Tim's boss,
            Oks the purchase of a NeXT cube, and allows Tim to go ahead and write a global hypertext system. <br>
            October <br> Tim starts work on a hypertext GUI browser+editor using the NeXTStep development environment.
            He makes up "WorldWideWeb" as a name for the program. (See <a href="">the first browser</a>  screenshot) "World Wide Web" as
            a name for the project (over Information Mesh, Mine of Information, and Information Mine). <br> Project 
             <a href="">original proposal</a> reformulated with encouragement from CN and ECP divisional management. Robert <a href=""> Cailliau</a> 
            (ECP) joins and is co-author of  <a href="">new version.</a><br>November <br> Initial <a href="">WorldWideWeb program</a>  development continues 
            on the NeXT (<a href="">TBL</a>) . This was a "what you see is what you get" (wysiwyg) browser/editor with direct inline creation of links. 
            The first web server was nxoc01.cern.ch, later called info.cern.ch, and the first web page http://nxoc01.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html 
            Unfortunately CERN no longer supports the historical site. Note from this era too, the <a href="">least recently modified web page </a> we know of, last changed 
            Tue, 13 Nov 1990 15:17:00 GMT (though the URI changed.) <br>November <br> Technical Student Nicola  <a href="">Pellow</a> (CN) joins and starts work on the line-mode browser.
            Bernd <a href="">Pollermann</a>  (CN) helps get interface to CERNVM "FIND" index running. TBL gives a  <a href="">colloquium</a> on hypertext in general. <br>Christmas <br>
            Line mode browser and <a href="">WorldWideWeb</a>  browser/editor demonstrable. Acces is possible to hypertext files, CERNVM "FIND", and Internet news articles.
